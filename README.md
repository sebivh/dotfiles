# Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the `init.sh` script as the User you are trying to istall for and select your OS. When asked for sudo privileges, enter your password.
3. The script will install all the OS specific dependencies like the shell and package manager. It will then continue installing all the Programs and their dependencies by running the `install.sh` script.
   ( If you try to install for root the script will stop at this step and inform you that you are dooing since it is uncoomend. If you still want to continue just run bash `install.sh')
